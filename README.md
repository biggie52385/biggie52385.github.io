### Profesional Self-Assesment
Looking back over the last few years I have spent working as a database Analyst and taking courses in the computer science field, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and believe
I am ready for the next step in choosing a career path. Along with working experience as a database Analyst, I have gained extensive knowledge in most
of the computer programming languages such as C++, Java, C#, and several database languages. This joined with the knowledge I gained from computer science
courses related to building and maintaining computer systems has provided me with a good platform for working in the computer science industry. I am prepared
for anything presented to me in a working environment and I am not afraid of learning new concepts. The e-portfolio I have created showcases my skills with computer
programming and database management. I was able to showcase my skills in writing and developing quality code, working with databases, and utilizing testing strategies.
All these concepts are necessary to master in order to be beneficial to an employer and I believe I was able to showcase these skills exceptionally.
